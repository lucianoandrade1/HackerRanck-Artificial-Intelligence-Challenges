#HackerRack Correlation and Regression Lines - A Quick Recap #1 challenge
#Author: Luciano Andrade

#Here are the test scores of 10 students in physics and history:

#Physics Scores  15  12  8   8   7   7   7   6   5   3
#History Scores  10  25  17  11  13  17  20  13  9   15
#Compute Karl Pearsonâ€™s coefficient of correlation between these scores.
#Compute the answer correct to three decimal places.

#Output Format

#In the text box, using the language of your choice, print the floating point/decimal value required. 
#Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.

#For example, if your answer is 0.255. In python you can print using
